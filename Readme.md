Welcome to Potato V2 - An attempt at a more comprehensive beginner's vault. I will be making a build-with-me series on youtube. Proper playlist link is pending. [Here is a playlist which should have relevant obsidian tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGoopqb7LiGIcsfgeiFWvvGOXxRZ8z35n).

This vault is meant to be like DOOM for Emacs. Where I provide a minimal base with all the quality of life settings already setup but still 'basic' enough that people can add their own system on top. Also optionally just use it as it is.

Things new users should do:
- [ ] Check out my [[Documentation File]] for hotkeys. 
- [ ] Set up your [[Daily Note Template]], [[Monthly Review Template]], [[Monthly Review Template]]
	- [ ] Add to the Quick Add Plugin for your daily note rollups 

Features that it comes with:
- Templater is already setup.
